description: Extract data from a source, transform it according to rules, validate the output, and load it into a destination
outcome: Data successfully extracted, transformed, validated, and loaded into the target destination

states:
  - key: Extract
    description: Connect to the data source and extract raw data according to the specified query or schema
    outcome: Raw dataset extracted and available for transformation
    events:
      dataExtracted: When raw data is successfully extracted from the source
      extractionFailed: When the source is unreachable, authentication fails, or the query returns an error

  - key: Transform
    description: Apply transformation rules — mapping, filtering, enrichment, deduplication, and format conversion
    outcome: Data transformed according to all specified rules
    events:
      dataTransformed: When all transformation rules have been applied successfully
      transformFailed: When a transformation rule fails or produces invalid output

  - key: Validate
    description: Check transformed data against schema constraints, business rules, and data quality thresholds
    outcome: Validation report confirming data meets all quality criteria
    events:
      dataValid: When data passes all schema constraints, business rules, and quality thresholds
      dataInvalid: When data fails validation — schema mismatch, business rule violation, or quality below threshold

  - key: Load
    description: Write validated data to the target destination — database, file system, API, or data warehouse
    outcome: Data loaded into the destination with confirmation of record counts and integrity
    events:
      loadComplete: When all records are loaded and integrity checks pass
      loadFailed: When the destination rejects data, connectivity fails, or integrity checks fail
